For each quad
	1 - take first and third points in the face (they will form a diagonal)
 	2 - merge the second point into the first one, taking the (non repeating) sum of edges connected to each of them, and assigning that to the first point
	3 - remove the second point from the list
	3 - update the points connected to the second point to show them as connected to the first
	4 - update the faces connected to the second point 
	4 - remove the quad from the list



Then we might have spurious edges which we'll have to remove to get the topology generator.
